The original version of this project was developed and awarded "Best Social Good/Awareness Hack" and "Best Use of Google Cloud" at BeachHacks2021. We are continuously pushing new features to this project, and the main branch is maintained by a8-s @ https://github.com/a8-s/Ecoswap

# Elevator Pitch  
In traditional comercial environments, small businesses and retailers have a means of escalating their businesses because they are seen as a physical alternative. In e-commerce however, customers on tillys.com or khols.com aren't as likely to consider more artisan retailers. What if you knew ahead of time the exact item you liked on amazon was also made handcrafted by a skilled individual on Etsy, for half the price. That's what Ecoswap is here for! Any item you look up to buy, we'll auto suggest alternatives from etsy, craigslist, and ebay.

Whether your goal is to save money through used products, or you just want to support independent artists and artisans, EcoSwap is your friend for just about any e-commerce experience. Our chrome extension takes qualitative measures of the item you're shopping for, and displays posts for cheaper/better equivalents!
