# Ecoswap

In traditional comercial environments, small businesses and retailers have a means of escalating their businesses because they are seen as a physical alternative. In e-commerce however, customers on tillys.com or khols.com aren't as likely to consider more artisan retailers. What if you knew ahead of time the exact item you liked on amazon was also made handcrafted by a skilled individual on Etsy, for half the price. That's what Ecoswap is here for! Any item you look up to buy, we'll auto suggest alternatives on etsy.

For those with an ecofriendly or money-concious mindset, consider future features optimized to suggest related (or exact) used sale posts of the item you're looking at. We're currently waiting on approval from Ebay's developer community so we can use their API, and in the future we might see OfferUP and LetGo open their APIs for developers.
